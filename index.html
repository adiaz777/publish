				<h2> ✦  About Me  ✦</h2>
				<p> My name is Alicia and I am currently learning how to code at Saint Paul College. I have tried taking several courses in order to find something I really like but working with computers is something that has always been in the back of my mind. Coding always sounded fun but also intimidating. It's learning a new language! However I finally decided to go for it this year and it has been such an interesting and fun journey!This website showcases some of the skills I have learned so far.</p>
				<p>Some of the reasons coding is fun to me!</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Endless ways to customize a page!</li>
					<li>It's exciting to see the results of your work when the code runs how you want it to!</li>
					<li>Sounds like a cool job to have one day!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>There is so much to do and I want to learn as much of it as I can! I will continue to use what I learn to create things during my spare time to put my skills into practice.</p>

				<p>A couple things I enjoy outside of class are reading (of all sorts of genres), playing video games, and hanging out with my friends.</p>
